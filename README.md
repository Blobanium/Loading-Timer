# Loading timer

## What is this?

this is an attempt at creating my mod with fabricmc, it shows you in logs on how much time it took to load minecraft.

## What inspired me to make this mod?

so there was this one mod for forge 1.8.9 Called "Patcher" It is an Optimization Mod Made My A Person Named By sk1er. There Was this one feature that showed you How long Minecraft took to start up, i really liked the feature But however i couldn't find any mod in the Fabricmc toolchain that could do that exact feature so i decided to make one myself. It Honestly Took me About 2 Days To Create this mod From the ground up due to the lack of knowledge knowing the java language but i finally got it to work! Hooray for me!
